## Ray tracing in one weekend, in Rust

This is an implementation in Rust of [Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing In One Weekend"](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book.

I know I'm not the first to reimplement code from this tutorial, but I tried to improve the modularity of this code a
bit and make it more idiomatic for this language. Nevertheless, it was a useful experience.
